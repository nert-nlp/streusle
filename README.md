STREUSLE stands for Supersense-Tagged Repository of English with a Unified Semantics for Lexical Expressions. The text is from the web reviews portion of the English Web Treebank [9]. STREUSLE incorporates comprehensive annotations of __multiword expressions__ (MWEs) [1] and semantic __supersenses__ for lexical expressions. The supersense labels apply to single- and multiword __noun__ and __verb__ expressions, as described in [2], and __prepositional__/__possessive__ expressions, as described in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Lexical expressions also feature a __lexical category__ label indicating its holistic grammatical status; for verbal multiword expressions, these labels incorporate categories from the PARSEME 1.1 guidelines [15]. For each token, these pieces of information are concatenated together into a __lextag__: a sentence's words and their lextags are sufficient to recover lexical categories, supersenses, and multiword expressions [8].

🧮 **_[Corpus Stats](STATS.md)_**: >55k words, >3k multiword expression instances, >22k supersense-tagged expressions

👩‍💻 **_Using the data_**: The canonical file with source annotations is streusle.conllulex.
**For scripting, the JSON format will likely be preferred. See [Formats](#formats) below.**

The English Web Treebank sentences were also used by the [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) project as the primary reference corpus for English [10]. STREUSLE incorporates the syntactic and morphological parses from UD\_English-EWT v2.16 (released May 15, 2025); these follow the UD v2 standard.

The UD annotations are redistributed under the same license. The source sentences and PTB part-of-speech annotations, which are from the Reviews section of the __English Web Treebank__ (EWTB; [9]), are redistributed with permission of Google and the Linguistic Data Consortium, respectively.

An independent effort to improve the MWE annotations from those in STREUSLE 3.0 resulted in the [HAMSTER](https://github.com/eltimster/HAMSTER) resource [14]. The HAMSTER revisions have not been merged with the 4.0 revisions, though we intend to do so for a future release.

Formats
-------

- The canonical data format for STREUSLE 4.0+ is the [CONLLULEX](CONLLULEX.md) tabular format. It extends the CoNLL-U format from the Universal Dependencies project with additional columns for lexical semantic annotations. (The .sst and .tags formats from STREUSLE 3.0 are not expressive enough and are no longer supported.)

- Scripts support conversion between .conllulex and a JSON format: conllulex2json.py, json2conllulex.py.
A JSON file can be enriched with syntactic details of the preposition/possessive relations via the govobj.py script.
JSON files are included in the train, dev, and test subdirectories.

- Other scripts support conversion between .conllulex and [Excel-compatible CSV](EXCEL.md).

- Luke Gessler has written a module for the [Pepper](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/) tool so that STREUSLE data can be converted to other Pepper-supported formats, including PAULA XML and ANNIS. See [instructions for converting](https://github.com/nert-nlp/streusle-pepper-importer).

History

### Synopsis of changes since 4.0

The 4.0 release [7] updates the inventory and application of preposition supersenses, applies those supersenses to possessives (detailed in [6]), incorporates the syntactic annotations from the Universal Dependencies project, and adds __lexical category__ labels to indicate the holistic grammatical status of strong multiword expressions. The 4.1 release adds subtypes for verbal MWEs (VID, VPC.{full,semi}, LVC.{full,cause}, IAV) according to PARSEME 1.1 guidelines [15]. The 4.2 and 4.3 releases revise some of the semantic annotations. The 4.4 release updates only UD annotations. The 4.5 release updates UD annotations and renames a couple of semantic labels.

### Detailed changes

  - STREUSLE 4.5: 2022-06-15.
     * Update SNACS annotations to the v2.6 standard (automatically rename p.Causer -> p.Force and p.RateUnit -> p.SetIteration).
     * Update UD to v2.10. This affects many UPOS tags and lemmas, especially for proper names. The UD update also introduces lines encoding multiword tokens (not to be confused with multiword *expressions*) for clitics.
  - STREUSLE 4.4: 2020-11-04.
     * Update govobj.py to recognize a different style of annotation for preposition stranding.
     * Update UD to v2.6.
     * Link from README to [16], a new paper on converting STREUSLE annotations to UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation), which uses this version of the data in experiments.
  - STREUSLE 4.3: 2020-05-01.
     * Updated preposition/possessive annotations to SNACS v2.5 guidelines ([5], specifically <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02134v6>), which includes changes in the set of labels.
     * Added a sentence that had been omitted from a document in the training set.
     * Updated UD parses to the latest dev version (post-v2.5). This improves lemmas for misspelled words and adds paragraph boundaries.
     * Link from README to new Pepper converter module.
     * Link from README to online search tool using ANNIS.
  - STREUSLE 4.2: 2020-01-01.
     * Added streuseval.py, a unified evaluation script for MWEs + supersenses (issue #31).
     * Added streusvis.py, for viewing sentences with their MWE and supersense annotations.
     * Added supdate.py (sentence-wise) and tupdate.py (token-wise) for editing lexical semantic annotations (issue #54).
     * Added format conversion scripts conllulex2json.py, conllulex2UDlextag.py, and UDlextag2json.py.
     * Normalized the way MWEs within a sentence are numbered in markup (normalize_mwe_numbering.py, issue #42).
     * Several improvements to govobj.py (most notably issue #35, affecting 184 tokens, and a small fix in 58db569 which affected 53 tokens).
     * Subdirectories for splits (train/, dev/, test/) now include .json and .govobj.json files alongside the source .conllulex.
     * Added release preparation scripts under releaseutil/.
     * Added setup.py.
     * Fixed a very small bug in tquery.py affecting the display of sentence-final matches, and made minor changes in functionality involving null values and negative constraints; token-level attributes of multiword expressions; and a new option to filter by sentence length.
     * Manually corrected all tokens with the placeholder lexcat symbol `!!@` (introduced in v4.0) to have a real lexcat and, if appropriate, a supersense (issue #15).
     * A number of revisions to SNACS (preposition/possessive supersense) annotations coordinated with updated guidelines ([5], specifically SNACS v2.4, <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02134v5>; this incorporates updates for SNACS v2.3 as well).
     * Minor corrections in the data and validation improvements.
     * Updated UD parses to the latest dev version (post-v2.5). Among other things, this improves lemmas for words with nonstandard spellings.
  - STREUSLE 4.1: 2018-07-02. Added subtypes to verbal MWEs (871 tokens) per PARSEME Shared Task 1.1 guidelines [15]; some MWE groupings revised in the process.
    Minor improvements to SNACS (preposition/possessive supersense) annotations coordinated with updated guidelines ([5], specifically <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02134v3>).
    Implementation of SNACS (preposition/possessive supersense) target identification heuristics from [7].
    New utility scripts for listing/filtering tokens (tquery.py) and converting to and from an Excel-compatible CSV format.
  - STREUSLE 4.0: 2018-02-10. Updated preposition supersenses to new annotation scheme (4398 tokens).
    Annotated possessives (1117 tokens) using preposition supersenses.
    Revised a considerable number of MWEs involving prepositions.
    Added lexical category for every single-word or strong multiword expression.
    New data format (.conllulex) integrates gold syntactic annotations from the Universal Dependencies project.
  - STREUSLE 3.0: 2016-08-23. Added preposition supersenses
  - STREUSLE 2.1: 2015-09-25. Various improvements chiefly to auxiliaries, prepositional verbs; added <code>\`p</code> class label as a stand-in for preposition supersenses to be added in a future release, and <code>\`i</code> for infinitival 'to' where it should not receive a supersense. From 2.0 (not counting <code>\`p</code> and <code>\`i</code>):
    * Annotations have changed for 877 sentences (609 involving changes to labels, 474 involving changes to MWEs).
    * 877 class labels have been changed/added/removed, usually involving a non-supersense label or triggered by an MWE change. Most frequently (118 cases) this was to replace `stative` with the auxiliary label <code>\`a</code>. In only 21 cases was a supersense label replaced with a different supersense label.
  - STREUSLE 2.0: 2015-03-29. Added noun and verb supersenses
  - CMWE 1.0: 2014-03-26. Multiword expressions for 55k words of English web reviews
